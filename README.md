## 📌 Problem Statement

Offline elections, where voters physically cast their ballots, have been the traditional method of voting for many years. While offline elections have their advantages, there are several problems associated with this type of voting system:

1. **Voter Intimidation**  
   Voters may feel intimidated or coerced at polling stations, especially in regions with a history of violence or political unrest.

2. **Fraud**  
   Offline elections are susceptible to fraudulent activities such as ballot stuffing, vote buying, and voter impersonation.

3. **Accessibility**  
   Individuals with disabilities or those living in remote areas face challenges in participating in offline voting.

4. **Long Waiting Times**  
   During peak voting periods, long queues at polling stations may discourage voter turnout.

## ✅ Our Solution

We propose a **Blockchain-Based Decentralized Online Voting System** that addresses the shortcomings of offline voting.

### 🔒 Key Features
- **Blockchain Security**  
  Each vote is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain — encrypted, time-stamped, and distributed across multiple nodes. This ensures **tamper-proof** and **transparent** election data.

- **Voter Authentication**  
  Aadhaar and voter details are used for **secure voter registration**.

- **Multi-Phase Distribution Approach**  
  The portal supports different election phases:  
  - Registration Ongoing  
  - Registration Finished  
  - Voting Ongoing  
  - Voting Finished  

  This structure ensures smooth election management, reduces errors, and gives voters ample time to participate.

- **OTP-Based Verification**  
  During voting, an **OTP is sent to the voter’s mobile phone** for identity verification before casting the vote.

- **Role-Based Access Control**  
  Only the **Admin** has permission to edit candidate and voter lists.
